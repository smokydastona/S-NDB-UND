# This is the version where your platform stops being a workstation and becomes middleware, runtime, and ecosystem.
v1 = one‑stop shop
v2 = professional workstation
v3 = full sound‑design platform
v4 = real‑time, interactive, adaptive audio engine + ecosystem
Let’s lock it in cleanly.

🐉 S‑NDB‑UND v4 — The Adaptive Audio Engine & Ecosystem
v4 is where S‑NDB‑UND evolves from “create sounds” to “create, manage, and run sounds in real time.”
This is the milestone where you rival FMOD, Wwise, and AAA middleware — but open‑source and AI‑powered.
Below is the complete v4 spec.

🎮 1. Real‑Time Audio Engine (Runtime Layer)
This is the biggest leap: S‑NDB‑UND becomes a runtime audio engine.
Features
• 	Real‑time playback engine
• 	Real‑time DSP (filters, EQ, reverb, pitch, time‑stretch)
• 	Real‑time parameter automation
• 	Real‑time crossfades and transitions
• 	Real‑time layering (creature roar built from multiple layers on the fly)
• 	Real‑time randomization (pitch, volume, sample selection)
• 	Real‑time state machine (idle → alert → attack → death)
Why this matters
You can now run your sound logic inside a game or simulation.

🧠 2. Adaptive Audio Logic (AI‑Driven Middleware)
v4 introduces adaptive audio, similar to Wwise/FMOD — but smarter.
Features
• 	Behavior trees for sound logic
• 	AI‑assisted parameter tuning
• 	AI‑generated transitions (smooth between states)
• 	AI‑generated variations on the fly
• 	Context‑aware sound selection:
• 	distance
• 	health
• 	biome
• 	time of day
• 	aggression level
Example
A creature’s roar automatically becomes:
• 	louder when enraged
• 	breathier when injured
• 	more distant when far away
• 	more reverberant in caves
All handled by S‑NDB‑UND’s runtime.

🎧 3. Procedural Runtime Synthesis
v4 adds real‑time procedural audio, not just offline generation.
Modules
• 	procedural footsteps
• 	procedural wind
• 	procedural fire
• 	procedural magic hums
• 	procedural UI bleeps
• 	procedural creature breaths
Why this matters
You can generate infinite variations during gameplay, not just in the editor.

🧩 4. Game Engine Plugins (Unity, Unreal, Godot)
v3 exported assets.
v4 integrates directly into engines.
Unity Plugin
• 	S‑NDB‑UND runtime component
• 	Inspector UI for adaptive audio
• 	ScriptableObject sound graphs
• 	Real‑time AI variation generation
Unreal Plugin
• 	S‑NDB‑UND MetaSound nodes
• 	Blueprint integration
• 	Real‑time DSP nodes
• 	Adaptive audio graphs
Godot Plugin
• 	GDScript bindings
• 	Real‑time DSP
• 	Adaptive audio nodes
Why this matters
Developers can use S‑NDB‑UND inside their game, not just before it.

🌐 5. S‑NDB‑UND Hub (Cloud Library + Collaboration)
v4 introduces a shared ecosystem.
Features
• 	Cloud library of:
• 	presets
• 	FX chains
• 	sound packs
• 	hybrid engine templates
• 	Team collaboration:
• 	shared projects
• 	version control
• 	comments
• 	approvals
• 	Sync between devices
• 	Optional self‑hosted mode
Why this matters
Teams can work like AAA studios.

🧬 6. Model Training Studio (AI Lab)
v4 adds a full training environment.
Features
• 	Dataset builder
• 	Auto‑labeling
• 	Auto‑augmentation
• 	Fine‑tuning UI
• 	Model comparison
• 	Model versioning
• 	Training presets (creature, ambience, UI, biome)
Why this matters
You can create your own AI sound models without touching code.

🎚️ 7. Advanced Hybrid Engine v4
v3 hybrid = AI + procedural + sample.
v4 hybrid = AI + procedural + sample + real‑time DSP + adaptive logic.
Pipeline
1. 	AI base
2. 	Procedural transient
3. 	Sample texture
4. 	Real‑time DSP
5. 	Adaptive logic
6. 	FX chain
7. 	Export or runtime playback
Why this matters
You get cinematic, dynamic, living creature audio.

🖥️ 8. GUI v3 — Full Audio Middleware Interface
v4 GUI becomes a middleware editor, similar to Wwise.
Panels
• 	Sound graph editor
• 	State machine editor
• 	Parameter automation curves
• 	Real‑time profiler
• 	Real‑time mixer
• 	Real‑time DSP rack
• 	Game simulation preview
Why this matters
You can design adaptive audio without writing code.

📦 9. Sound Pack Marketplace (Optional)
v4 introduces a community marketplace.
Content
• 	presets
• 	FX chains
• 	sound packs
• 	hybrid engine templates
• 	training datasets
• 	plugins
Why this matters
S‑NDB‑UND becomes an ecosystem.

🏆 What v4 Achieves
At v4, S‑NDB‑UND is no longer a generator or editor.
It becomes:
• 	a DAW
• 	an AI sound generator
• 	a procedural synthesizer
• 	a sound pack builder
• 	a runtime audio engine
• 	an adaptive audio middleware
• 	a plugin platform
• 	a training studio
• 	a cloud collaboration hub
• 	a marketplace
